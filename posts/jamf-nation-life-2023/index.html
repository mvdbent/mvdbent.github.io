Therefore, I want to provide some useful information that can help you if you are coming to one of the events!\nUseful information Besides seeing the great opening keynote, there will be many other great presentations, interactive sessions, and panels where you’ll hear from Jamf and other members of Jamf Nation community on the latest regarding managing and securing your devices.\nApp to help you organise the day To help you organize your agenda and see where you want to go, Jamf has created an exciting app this year (more details will be included in the reminder email). Once you download the app and log in, you’ll have access to the full agenda, allowing you to handpick the sessions that align perfectly with your interests and goals.\nDon’t worry about being locked into a specific track, even if you indicated a preference during registration. You are free to explore and choose sessions from different rooms based on your personal preferences. The rooms are themed, focusing on Management, Security, and Education (with a special focus on Jamf users in educational institutions).\nLive Lounge \u0026 Jamf Booths I’m thrilled to see the new addition that Jamf created this year: Live Lounge, for exclusive roundtable experiences. Keep an eye out for them on the app when it launches, as spaces will be limited. If you’re eager to participate in dedicated, themed conversations with our product or support teams, make sure to sign up!\nLike last year, you can drop by the Jamf booths, where you can meet and engage with Jamf’s knowledgeable teams, including Services, Education, Engineers, and Security. They’ll be there to address any inquiries or discuss topics of interest with you. My team and I are also walking around, so don’t hesitate to look me up. I’m happy to connect with you and have great conversations, even if it’s just to say hello!\nVenues, Food and beverage The London and Amsterdam venues have both indoor and outdoor spaces. While we can’t predict the weather (but keep an eye on the weather app for sunglasses or even sunscreen), rest assured that all presentation areas are covered. It’s always a good idea to dress in layers, as temperatures might vary. If you want to bring a coat solely for the evening, Jamf offers a cloakroom service where you can also get assistance with storing your luggage or bulky bags.\nTo keep your inner body happy and fueled throughout the day, Jamf is providing breakfast, lunch, and snacks, taking into account various dietary needs. Additionally, they have delectable treats available after the evening reception when drinks are served.\nCommunity One of the greatest aspects of Jamf is its vibrant user community. I encourage you to dive right in, meet fellow attendees, and share your own tips and tricks. With around 500 people expected to join us, you’ll have the opportunity to connect with many other first-time attendees.\nDo you have any other questions? Look me up or feel free to ask any James around, and I know we’ll do our best to assist you.\nEnjoy Jamf Nation Live 2023!","wordCount":"585","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-05-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-05-02T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://appleshare.it/posts/jamf-nation-life-2023/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"AppleShare IT","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://appleshare.it/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://appleshare.it/ accesskey=h title="AppleShare IT (Alt + H)">AppleShare IT</a>
