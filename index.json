The guys from the macOS Security Compliance Project did an amazing job automating the guidance and configuration profiles.\nI created custom rules set for CIS Benchmark to integrate with the macOS Security Compliance Project and published CIS-macOS-Security.\nWhile working with CIS Benchmark, Script and Configuration Profile, I had the feeling there was missing a overview with compleet reporting, and there for build a read only CIS-Reporting script you can find here\nEnded up with seperate tools, creation of the Documention, Configuration Profiles and Reporting. However I still needed an extra script for remediation.\nTo resolve this I combined the reporting script with remediation with the option to enable remediation or not.\nAnd we need to keep in mind that every year we get a new macOS release and like macOS, Security is a moving target. Basically things change, and we don\u0026rsquo;t want to edit and maintain an 3000 line script. This will be hard to maintain if a new macOS has released.\nFor that reason, and for easy maintaining, the CIS-Script is assembled out of a bunch of fragments.\n Here structure of the CIS Script folder, in the root of the folder, there is a symbolic link to the assemble script. The original is in the Utils folder, with some other script you can use. All script that you assamble/create will be stored in the Build folder. For implementation into the jamf pro server there are some resources in the Jamf Folder.\nIn the Fragments folder. Here you will have the Header.sh, Footer.sh and Version.sh files with all the logic and functions that will be assembled into the script. In the OrgScore Folder are all the separate CIS Benchmark OrgScore*.sh. Every CIS Benchmark orgScore you can test separately if you need to trouble shoot or extend it with the new macOS.\nCIS Benchmark OrgScore Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look how the CIS Benchmark OrgScore, looks like.\n#!/bin/zsh  script_dir=$(dirname ${0:A}) projectfolder=$(dirname $script_dir) source ${projectfolder}/Header.sh CISLevel=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34; audit=\u0026#34;2.1.1 Turn off Bluetooth, if no paired devices exist (Automated)\u0026#34; orgScore=\u0026#34;OrgScore2_1_1\u0026#34; emptyVariables # Verify organizational score runAudit # If organizational score is 1 or true, check status of client if [[ \u0026#34;${auditResult}\u0026#34; == \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; ]]; then method=\u0026#34;Script\u0026#34; remediate=\u0026#34;Script - defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth ControllerPowerState -bool false\u0026#34; connectable=$(system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 | grep -c \u0026#34;Paired: Yes\u0026#34;) bluetoothEnabled=$(defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth ControllerPowerState -bool) comment=\u0026#34;Paired Devices: ${connectable}\u0026#34; # if [[ \u0026#34;$connectable\u0026#34; == 0 ]] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; [[ \u0026#34;$bluetoothEnabled\u0026#34; == 0 ]]; then if [[ \u0026#34;$connectable\u0026#34; -gt 0 ]] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; [[ \u0026#34;$bluetoothEnabled\u0026#34; == 1 ]] || [[ \u0026#34;$connectable\u0026#34; == 0 ]] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; [[ \u0026#34;$bluetoothEnabled\u0026#34; == 0 ]]; then result=\u0026#34;Passed\u0026#34; else result=\u0026#34;Failed\u0026#34; comment=\u0026#34;No Paired Devices” # Remediation if [[ \u0026#34;${remediateResult}\u0026#34; == \u0026#34;enabled\u0026#34; ]]; then defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth ControllerPowerState -bool false killall -HUP bluetoothd # re-check connectable=$(system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 | grep -c \u0026#34;Paired: Yes\u0026#34;)bluetoothEnabled=$(defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth ControllerPowerState -bool)if [[ \u0026#34;$connectable\u0026#34; == 0 ]] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; [[ \u0026#34;$bluetoothEnabled\u0026#34; == 0 ]]; then result=\u0026#34;Passed After Remediation\u0026#34; else result=\u0026#34;Failed After Remediation\u0026#34; fi fi fi fi printReport We runAudit to verify the organizational score. If scored we perform an audit to check the state. Then Check if remediateResult is enabled, and if enabled we remediate, we perform an audit to check if remediation succeeded and report back so we can read this out in report\nTo some up what the org score is doing, is Audit, Remediate and report.\nFor adjustments or testing, you can run every OrgScore seperatly.\n$ cd /Git/CIS-Script/Fragments/OrgScores $ sudo ./OrgScore*.sh Custom CIS Benchmark OrgScore You can make your own custom OrgScore, which you can include into the CIS-Script. Make sure that the name of the file is the same as the OrgScore within the script.\nPlace your custom OrgScore in the Framework/OrgScore folder.\nAssemble Remediation Script To assemble all the fragements together in a full Script CISBenchmarkScript.sh which you can use standalone or via an MDM server (like Jamf Pro) you can use the Assemble.sh script.\nThe Assemble.sh will default build the full Remediation Script CISBenchmarkScript.sh.\n$ ./Assemble.sh You can create seperate script by running the script with -s [\u0026ndash;separate] option\n$ ./Assemble.sh -s With the following command ./Assemble.sh -h you can read about the options.\nThe following options are available: -j --json Builds Jamf Pro Custom Schema.json file -s --separate Builds separate CIS Benchmark Script from the fragements -h --help Displays this message or details on a specific verb EXAMPLES ./Assemble.sh Builds CIS Benchmark Script from the fragements ./Assemble.sh -j Builds Jamf Pro Custom Schema.json file ./Assemble.sh -s Builds separate CIS Benchmark Script from the fragements The Assemble.sh script will built the full script in ./Build/ and the seperate scripts in ./Build/Scripts/ folder.\nCIS Benchmark Script The CISBenchmarkScript.sh Script can be run as a local standalone script, and will preform a read only audit which creates a full report. Location of the report /Library/Security/Reports/\n$ sudo ./CISBenchmarkScript.sh You can create a Full Report by running the script with -f [\u0026ndash;fullreport] option\n$ sudo ./CISBenchmarkScript.sh -f You can enable remediation by running the script with -r [\u0026ndash;remediate] option\n$ sudo ./CISBenchmarkScript.sh -r With the following command ./Build/CISBenchmarkScript.sh -h you can read about the options.\nThe following options are available: -f\t--fullreport\tPrint Full Report -h\t--help\tDisplays this message or details on a specific verb -r\t--remediate\tEnable Remediation EXAMPLES ./CISBenchmarkScript.sh -f Run script to print Full Report ./CISBenchmarkScript.sh -r Run script with Remediation enabled ./CISBenchmarkScript.sh -rf Run script with Remediation enabled and print Full Report Implementation Jamf Pro Server Upload the assembled CISBenchmarkScript.sh Script into the Jamf Pro Server.\nUpload the Extension Atrributes into you Jamf Pro Server. Location Extension Atrributes\nCIS Benchmark Settings Configuration Profile If you use the script via a Jamf Pro you can set the script to create a short or full report, and enable or disable remediation. By using a mobile config we can control and set the organisation scoring and CIS script settings.\nFor easy creation of the CIS script Configure profile, you can use the Assemble.sh script with -j [\u0026ndash;json] option to generate an JSON Schema manifests from all the fragments in OrgScores folder (including custom OrgScores).\n$ sudo ./CISBenchmarkScript.sh -j Create a new computer configuration profile, give the profile a name and add the policy to a categorie, within the Application \u0026amp; Custom Settings payload, upload the just generated Custom Schema.json file, make sure that you check if you upload the just created file, Fill in the preference domain.\nNow you can configure what you need the CIS script to do, full or short report, remediation enabled or not, and go through the list and enable/disable the org scores where you need to score on.\nAfter we uploaded the CIS scripts, Configuration profile and Extension Attribute into the Jamf Pro Server, the last thing we need to do is, to create a policy. Create a new policy, choose the preferred trigger, set the preferred frequency, add the CIS Script and don’t forget to scope.\nAfter you scoped the CIS script Configure profile and the Policy with the script to the Target Devices.\nYou are ready to get compliant and know the state of your devices Resources github.com/mvdbent/CIS-Script\n","permalink":"https://appleshare.it/posts/cis-script/","summary":"This CIS Script is build to report and remediate based on the your organisation score.\nWhile working with CIS Benchmarks (Remediation Scripts and/or Configuration Profiles) I felt this could be done better, faster and easier.

Setting up a light to show when you are \u0026ldquo;ON AIR\u0026rdquo; or in a meeting is a great solution. There are several solutions out on the internet that can do this. Still, a lot of these solutions connect to your calendar via IFTTT or Zapier and then you need to create an action with homekit or homebridge to turn on a light with the colour red when in a meeting and green when it is safe to enter. Another straightforward way is to buy a button that turns a light on or off. (The trick is to try not to forget to push the button, I always forget)\nIn this case, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t connect my work calendar these 3rd party services or send a webhook event from an API, when a meeting has started or ended.\nAlso, another challenge is that I am using multiple meeting applications (Zoom, WebEx, Microsoft Teams, Slack, etc.), and each application has its way of doing things.\nThen when discussing with my manager and colleagues, I came up with an idea to have a script that monitors your mac for an active online meeting. When the camera and mic are on!! As in full active participation, not just listing in. Once a meeting found, it can then control the HueLights via API.\nSet up What i used for this setup:\n Philips Hue Bridge v2 Hue Bloom - Model: LLC011 Web Browser (Safari, Google Chrome) Text Editor (BBEdit, Coderunner) macOS Automator.app (located in /Applications)  Create a API user in Bridge link to source\nFirst we need to search for the Hue Bridge on your network. To lookup on your network use the following link: https://discovery.meethue.com/\nResult example:\n[{\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;001234ddse27c6be\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;internalipaddress\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;10.0.1.111\u0026#34;}] Use the internal API Debugger to create an API User, go to https://10.0.1.111/debug/clip.html Change #internalipaddress into the internalipaddress you just found.\nWe the following command in the API Debugger tool, we are generating a API user. Fill in the info like below (you can use your own name) in the API Debugger and press the POST button.\nURL: /api Message Body: {\u0026#34;devicetype\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;my_hue_app#username\u0026#34;} When you press the POST button you should get back an error message letting you know that you have to press the link button\nResult example:\n[ { \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: 101, \u0026#34;address\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;link button not pressed\u0026#34; } } ] Now press the button on the bridge and then press the POST button again and you should get a success response like below.\nResult example:\n[ { \u0026#34;success\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;FIAqb-53KaLBVzXKscihomProgvhUkRko59TAuV\u0026#34; } } ] We now have enabled an API user and now we can authenticate with the Hue Bridge for communication.
