Setting up a light to show when you are &amp;ldquo;ON AIR&amp;rdquo; or in a meeting is a great solution. There are several solutions out on the internet that can do this. Still, a lot of these solutions connect to your calendar via IFTTT or Zapier and then you need to create an action with homekit or homebridge to turn on a light with the colour red when in a meeting and green when it is safe to enter.</description></item></channel></rss>
