While working with CIS Benchmarks (Remediation Scripts and/or Configuration Profiles) I felt this could be done better, faster and easier. The guys from the macOS Security Compliance Project did an amazing job automating the guidance and configuration profiles.
I created custom rules set for CIS Benchmark to integrate with the macOS Security Compliance Project and published CIS-macOS-Security.</description></item><item><title>CIS Custom Rules Set mSCP</title><link>https://appleshare.it/posts/cis-custom-rules-set-mscp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://appleshare.it/posts/cis-custom-rules-set-mscp/</guid><description>While working with CIS Benchmarks PDF (guidelines for scripts and/or Configuration Profiles) I felt there must be a better and faster way.

While i was working with Jamf&amp;rsquo;s CIS Benchmark, Script and Configuration Profile Remediation tool, I had the feeling there was missing a overview with compleet reporting. You can find some info by the device record in Jamf, however this was only for the Non-compliant items.
To expand the Jamf Proffessional Services CIS for macOS Catalina - Script and Configuration Profile Remediation, I created the 4_Security_Report.sh.
Usage/Requirements This script is tested on macOS Big Sur 11.</description></item></channel></rss>
