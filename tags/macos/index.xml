If your environment uses an HTTPS server that is NOT a Jamf Pro HTTPS-capable distribution point to host your packages, the requirements are to create a custom manifest file and upload it along with the Signed Distribution Package into Jamf Pro.
Before we start with covering the manifest file, I want to highlight that we need a Signed Distribution Package.</description></item><item><title>Automating CIS Benchmark Reporting and Remediation</title><link>https://appleshare.it/posts/automating-cis-benchmark/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://appleshare.it/posts/automating-cis-benchmark/</guid><description>Learn about a better, faster and easier way to report and remediate CIS Benchmarks.

Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to look at the USAGE section in the readme or use the --help option to read more about the usage and options.
Luckily, not much is needed to be dusted off. However, I wanted to add some adjustments and share my workflows which you can use within Jamf.</description></item><item><title>Automating CIS Benchmark Reporting and Remediation | MacSysAdmin 2021</title><link>https://appleshare.it/posts/macsysadminscis/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://appleshare.it/posts/macsysadminscis/</guid><description>I am so honoured to present at the online Mac Sys Admin this year.

While working with CIS Benchmarks (Remediation Scripts and/or Configuration Profiles) I felt this could be done better, faster and easier. The guys from the macOS Security Compliance Project did an amazing job automating the guidance and configuration profiles.
I created custom rules set for CIS Benchmark to integrate with the macOS Security Compliance Project and published CIS-macOS-Security.</description></item><item><title>CIS Custom Rules Set mSCP</title><link>https://appleshare.it/posts/cis-custom-rules-set-mscp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://appleshare.it/posts/cis-custom-rules-set-mscp/</guid><description>While working with CIS Benchmarks PDF (guidelines for scripts and/or Configuration Profiles) I felt there must be a better and faster way.

We built this tool three years ago, mostly because we wanted to learn how to build an app like this on macOS. We think it worked out well. We learned a lot, and are glad the application was useful to some.
Since then, all the people involved in the EraseInstall Project have moved on to other jobs or other responsibilities.</description></item><item><title>CIS-Reporting</title><link>https://appleshare.it/posts/cis-reporting/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://appleshare.it/posts/cis-reporting/</guid><description>github.com/mvdbent/CIS-Reporting
While i was working with Jamf&amp;rsquo;s CIS Benchmark, Script and Configuration Profile Remediation tool, I had the feeling there was missing a overview with compleet reporting. You can find some info by the device record in Jamf, however this was only for the Non-compliant items.
To expand the Jamf Proffessional Services CIS for macOS Catalina - Script and Configuration Profile Remediation, I created the 4_Security_Report.sh.
Usage/Requirements This script is tested on macOS Big Sur 11.</description></item><item><title>onAirScanner</title><link>https://appleshare.it/posts/onairscanner/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://appleshare.it/posts/onairscanner/</guid><description>While working from home, we all have a lot of meetings, and sometimes a family member or a roommate has no idea that you are in a meeting and they walk into the room without even a knock. Setting up a light to show when you are &amp;ldquo;ON AIR&amp;rdquo; or in a meeting is a great solution. There are several solutions out on the internet that can do this. Still, a lot of these solutions connect to your calendar via IFTTT or Zapier and then you need to create an action with homekit or homebridge to turn on a light with the colour red when in a meeting and green when it is safe to enter.</description></item><item><title>The story of trust destroyed | JNUC 2020</title><link>https://appleshare.it/posts/thestoryoftrustdestroyed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://appleshare.it/posts/thestoryoftrustdestroyed/</guid><description>The truth about MDM Migration: Journey through time as Jamf consulting engineer me and Rob Potvin will talk about the current design of the Apple MDM protocol and what the migration process looks like for moving existing devices from one MDM to another.
This can be fairly difficult, but success is possible with a bit of time, effort and planning. It is not really migrating, but destroying trust.

Secure Boot and the T2 system controller have changed the toolset available to Mac administrators. The new post-imaging world of Mojave requires new workflows. We learn about the role that &amp;lsquo;off-boarding&amp;rsquo; or the erase/install step has in the modern macOS deployment cycle. In this session, we will explore the startosinstall command in detail and learn about its uses and limitations. Finally, we will introduce a few workflows and tools (Erase&amp;amp;Install.</description></item></channel></rss>
