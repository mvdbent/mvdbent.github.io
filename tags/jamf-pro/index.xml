          This CIS Script is build to report and remediate based on the your organisation score.
While working with CIS Benchmarks (Remediation Scripts and/or Configuration Profiles) I felt this could be done better, faster and easier. The guys from the macOS Security Compliance Project did an amazing job automating the guidance and configuration profiles.

          While working from home, we all have a lot of meetings, and sometimes a family member or a roommate has no idea that you are in a meeting and they walk into the room without even a knock. Setting up a light to show when you are &#34;ON AIR&#34; or in a meeting is a great solution.
